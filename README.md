# Poker In Spiral

Series on articles on how to train a poker agent using a combination of Spiral and Python.

Update: I'll scrap the plans for this. The Cython backend has [performance](https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/Jd_Eqw2hWD0) on par with pure Python, meaning I can't use it to promote the benefits of Spiral. I could write the series without using Spiral, but I am not interested in doing a bunch of Python tutorials. Since I was going to do a C++ backend for the AI chips, I might as well get that out of the way now.
